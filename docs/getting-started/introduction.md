# üìñ About
Created on April 24th, 2021 by [Unnecessary Libraries](https://github.com/unnecessarylibraries). ImDragonsAPI was created to give fans one stop shop for a fast, and constantly updating database of infomation regarding the band [Imagine Dragons](https://www.imaginedragonsmusic.com/#/). Instantly giving results back and with no need to update your content constantly. Keeping your infomation up-to-date and never doing the pain staking process of copy and pasting Wikis!

# ü§î Why? 
ImDragonsAPI was created for the prupose to allow dvelopers that love Imagine Dragons. A place to simply access any data and resouces surrouding the band. However, that's not the only reason started this project. We had other intents in mind. We didn't jsut want to give fans a powerful API. We also wanted to give new and old developers a place to gain skills/knowlegde behind the backend processes. Skils like manipluating a API, using a API, and even creating your very own API. The power of ImDragonsAPI and its tools are at your disposal!

# üõ†Ô∏è Project Examples
