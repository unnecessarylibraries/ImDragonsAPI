# Background
Imagine-Dragons API (or "ImDragonsAPI") created on April 24th, of 2021. Is a Open API created by Unnecessary Libraries that allows for indexing of a massive collection of Data regarding the band Imagine Dragons. Created as a side Project from RobbiDev which is the Creator of Unnecessary Libraries (or UNLIBs). Allows for making HTTPs request to the API and returning a large amount of JSON data about the band. Data is so Diverse, you can get the littlest of data from about just anything.

# Why ImDragonsAPI? 
ImDragonsAPI was created primarily to develop new development skills. I used this project to help develop better understanding of backend processes. In return, I made a simple-to-use API for anyone to use and learn too.
You can use this API for any purpose you want.

Some examples you can try, are as follows:
- A Discord bot that gives Information regarding the band
- Creating connections with music streaming services like Spotify, Itunes, and Pandora
- Making fan-made Wikipedia for front-end learning too
...and So much more. Just use that amazing imagination!

Our main target audience was mainly directed towards developers who were starting to enter the backend world. Creating a simple, easy-to-use library that can help grow upon that entry. We also wanted to provide developers who are Imagine Dragons fans with a better way to obtain all things Imagine Dragons. Giving developers access to any data or information they would ever need about the band.
