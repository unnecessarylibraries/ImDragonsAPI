### Background

Imagine-Dragons API (or **"ImDragonsAPI"**) created on **April 24th, of 2021**. Is a Open API created by [Unnecessary Libraries](https://github.com/unnecessarylibs) that allows for indexing of a massive collection of Data regarding the band [**Imagine Dragons**](https://www.imaginedragonsmusic.com/#/). Created as a side Project from [RobbiDev](https://github.com/pengyofficial) which is the Creator of Unnecessary Libraries (or **UNLIBs**). Allows for making **HTTPs request** to the API and returning a large amount of JSON data about the band. Data is so Diverse, you can get the littlest of data from about just anything.

### Structure

ImDragonsAPI is simple to use and has an easy-to-understand structure. The data is sorted by two different types of categories: "collections" and "individuals." A collection is where a lot of detailed JSON is sorted. Collections contain multiple data objects in one file. An example  of this would be the album collection. It contains every album the band has ever released and is very detailed. On the other hand, "individuals" are the opposite. They are single JSON files that contain only one or two objects. An example of an individual would be a song like "Thunder," and the second object would contain all the lyrics.

### Why?

ImDragonsAPI was created primarily to develop new development skills. I used this project to help develop better understanding of backend processes. In return, I made a simple-to-use API for anyone to use and learn too.

You can use this API for any purpose you want. Some examples you can try, are as follows:

* A Discord bot that gives Information regarding the band
* Creating connections with music streaming services like Spotify, Itunes, and Pandora
* Making fan-made Wikipedia for front-end learning too
* **...and So much more. Just use that amazing imagination!**

Our main target audience was mainly directed towards developers who were starting to enter the backend world. Creating a simple, easy-to-use library that can help grow upon that entry. We also wanted to provide developers who are Imagine Dragons fans with a better way to obtain all things Imagine Dragons. Giving developers access to any data or information they would ever need about the band.
